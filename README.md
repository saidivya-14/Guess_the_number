# **Guess the Random Number Game**

## 🎮 **About the Project**
The **Guess the Random Number Game** is a fun Python-based project where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game will provide hints (higher or lower) until the player guesses the correct number.

This project is an excellent way to practice Python programming concepts like loops, conditional statements, and random number generation.

---

## 🚀 **Features**
- **Random Number Generation**: The game randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.
- **Hint System**: The game gives real-time feedback whether the guess is too high or too low.
- **Guess Count**: The player is shown the number of attempts it took to guess correctly.

## 🔧 **How to Run the Game**
### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.x installed on your computer.

### **Steps to Run**
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/guess-the-number.git
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd guess-the-number
3. Run the Python script:
   ``` bash
   python guess_the_number.py
4. Follow the instructions:
   - Enter your guess (a number between 1 and 100).
   - The game will guide you with hints until you guess the correct number.

## 📝 **Example Gameplay**
``` bash
Guess the number (between 1 and 100): 50
Too high! Try a lower number.
Guess the number (between 1 and 100): 25
Too low! Try a higher number.
Guess the number (between 1 and 100): 37
Congratulations! You guessed the number in 3 attempts.
```

## 🌟 **Future Enhancements**
- Add a difficulty setting to allow the user to select different ranges for the number (e.g., 1-1000).
- Track the player's best score (lowest number of attempts).
- Implement a timer to see how fast the player can guess the number.
